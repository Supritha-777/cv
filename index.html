    Greetings!Myself Supritha Sridharan. I would describe myself as a Self-Motivated Enthusiastic person,always eager to learn new skills and grow Intellectually as well as Personally.
    At the same time, I love to savour every little moment I spend with my family and friends.A keen observer of Nature too.Well,sometimes you can catch me staring at the sky,thinking to myself that we are all just stardusts in this vast Universe.

    <tr>
      <td>Piezo Electric Generator</td>
      <td> To develop a Piezo electric generator using Piezo crystals. By applying manual pressure to the crystal, a voltage drop is developed across it, thereby causing the LED light connected to the crystal to illuminate. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Design and Simulation of stepper Motor</td>
      <td>To design and analyse the working of a stepper motor. The model was simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and the speed variations of stepper motor subjected to potentiometer variations was carried out by the MATLAB code.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Robust Controller-Inverter based Grid System</td>
      <td>A robust controller using both PI and PR compensators along with active damping-capacitor-current feedback regulator is designed for an LCL filter-based Grid-connected inverter. The characteristics of the system was studied by obtaining bode plots, by developing a MATLAB code and simulating the same on MATLAB Simulink.</td>
